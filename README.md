# BLACKJACK PROJECT

## Week Three - Skill Distillery Project

I had some super problems getting this going, then it turned out that I was making it too difficult and it was as simple as getting the deck, then getting the individual cards, then getting the value of the card. Once that wee thing was resolved, it was much simpler.

Proverb of the day:
	Try, try, try, and try again...
					Winston Churchill.
					
For some reason the game logic was not working. It turned out that a variable was put into a 4 val method slightly in the wrong order. This meant the game logic would say that I busted, when I had actually stayed.

The game works for the tests and the testing that I have done.
